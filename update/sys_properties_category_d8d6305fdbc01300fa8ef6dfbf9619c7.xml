        <title><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Bookings application allows you to create Booking Templates &amp; Booking Schedules and to manage the Reservations made against them.</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-position: inside;"><li>First create your Booking Location</li><li>Next, create you Booking Resources for the location.  These could be campsites, wedding areas, tables at a cafe or any other bookable spaces.</li><li>Next, create your Booking Template for your resource, based upon your typical weekly schedule.  You need one Booking Template per resource.  It is highly recommended you review existing templates before attempting to create one of your own.   Make sure you have selected at least one day to generate the slots for and have entered a start and end time for when you are accepting bookings.
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;"><li>The &#39;Generate Template Slots&#39; link on the Booking Template form will allow you to auto-generate the baseline schedule from a few simple settings. Then, you can tweak the baseline schedule to exactly match your typical weekly schedule, editing the availability for each time slot throughout each day.</li></ul>
</li><li>Next, generate your first actual Booking Schedule using the &#39;Generate Schedule Days&#39; link on the Booking Template form.
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;"><li>While the Booking Template is a weekly template (with no associated dates), the actual Booking Schedule is the time/date/availability listing against which your users may book reservations.</li><li>Any abnormal scheduling changes (holidays, resources unexpectedly unavailable, increased resources for high usage period) should be made against the actual Booking Schedule and <em>not</em> the Booking Template.</li><li>After your first Schedule is generated, you should never need to re-generate the schedule unless the Booking Template changes. Each night, the app will automatically generate new Booking Schedule days in order to ensure the configured &#39;Days to Schedule&#39; are maintained. Check notes on the Booking Template form for details about editing an existing Booking Template.</li></ul>
</li><li>Accept reservations!
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;"><li>Users will now be able to make Reservations against the Booking Schedule. As users make Reservations, the available capacity during each slot will automatically decrement. As Reservations are cancelled, availability will automatically increment.</li><li>Reservations are only available during the existing Schedule, according to the &#39;Days to Schedule&#39; setting.</li><li>Reservations should only be made through the Angular application as this will ensure that all booking reservation details are captured correctly.</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Roles</strong>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;"><li><em>booking_user</em>: User of the Bookings application. Able to read all Schedule and Reservations records.</li><li><em>booking_admin</em>: Admin of the Bookings application. Able to read/edit/delete records from all Bookings tables, including Booking Templates, Booking  Schedules, and Reservations.</li></ul>]]></title>
